## Description (Work Day Scheduler)

- To create a workday scheduler using jquery and dayjs. 
- To implement current day and hour to organize schedules.
- How to select attributes by Id and add classes to divs using javaScript
- The commits to this repo were made and added to the original starter code which for some reason I didn't
- notice because it allowed me to add commits to it until I tried to push the final project and found that I couldn't find it in my git hub profile for me to deploy.
